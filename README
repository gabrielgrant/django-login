A very basic login and account management app for django. The functionality
and templates mirror that of the admin app, but without requiring the user
to be a staff member to use it.

##Installation

Ensure you've installed and configured the admin app, and then include 'login' in your list of installed apps:

    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'login'


Mapthe url specified in your settings.LOGIN_URL to django-login's views.
For example, using the defaults, add the following line to your URLconf:

    (r'^accounts/', include('login.urls')),
